# What is ILogger ? why we need to use?
ILogger is an interface provided by Microsoft in the Microsoft.Extensions.Logging namespace, designed to support logging in .NET applications. Logging is a crucial aspect of software development and maintenance for several reasons:

# What is ILogger?
ILogger is a generic interface used for logging messages at various levels of severity, such as Information, Warning, Error, and Debug. It provides a standardized way to include logging in your applications, making it easier to manage and filter logs.

# Why We Need to Use ILogger?
Here are some key reasons for using ILogger:

# Diagnostics and Debugging:

**Track Issues:** Helps in tracing application behavior and identifying where things go wrong.

**Detailed Information:** Provides insights into the application's flow, which is invaluable during debugging sessions.

# Monitoring:

**Performance Monitoring:** Keeps track of application performance, which can be analyzed to improve efficiency.

**Health Checks:** Logs can indicate the health of your application, such as response times, error rates, and usage patterns.

# Audit and Compliance:

**User Actions:** Logs can be used to track user actions for auditing purposes, ensuring compliance with regulations.

**Data Changes:** Keep a record of changes made to the system for future reference.

# Error Handling:

**Error Detection:** Immediate logging of errors helps in quicker detection and resolution.

**Prevention:** By analyzing logs, patterns can be identified that might prevent future errors.

# Security:

**Suspicious Activities:** Logging can help detect suspicious activities, potential security breaches, and unauthorized access.

**Forensic Analysis:** In the event of a security breach, logs can be used for forensic analysis to understand what went wrong.

# Example Usage of ILogger
Here's a quick example of how you might use ILogger in a service:

```cs
public class DepartmentService
{
    private readonly MyDbContext _context;
    private readonly ILogger<DepartmentService> _logger;

    public DepartmentService(MyDbContext context, ILogger<DepartmentService> logger)
    {
        _context = context;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public string UpdateDepartment(Department department)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("UpdateDepartment called for Department Id: {DepartmentId}", department.Id);

        var existingDepartment = _context.Departments.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Id == department.Id);
        if (existingDepartment != null)
        {
            existingDepartment.Name = department.Name;
            existingDepartment.DepartmentHead = department.DepartmentHead;

            _context.Entry(existingDepartment).State = Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.EntityState.Modified;

            try
            {
                _context.SaveChanges();
                _logger.LogInformation("Department Id: {DepartmentId} updated successfully", department.Id);
                return "Record Updated successfully";
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                _logger.LogError(ex, "Error updating Department Id: {DepartmentId}", department.Id);
                return "Error updating department";
            }
        }
        else
        {
            _logger.LogWarning("Department Id: {DepartmentId} not found", department.Id);
            return "Something went wrong while updating";
        }
    }
}
```
Using ILogger in your applications brings clarity and control over your application's operational status and helps in proactively managing and resolving issues
